This app is designed to produce math worksheets for my kids. The source code can be found at https://github.com/KT421/mathraces/

To use it, select one or more operations, give ranges for the operands (the numbers in the math problem) and click the "Generate Problems" button. If you like the problem list generated, click the "Download Printable" button and save and print the produced HTML file. 

For kindergartners, you will want to keep to addition and subtraction and operands between one and ten. My own kids have done best when focusing on one operation and keeping the second operand limited to a single number. For example, setting Operand 1 to 1-to-10 and Operand 2 to 2-to-2 allows us to practice adding and subtracting by twos. This could also be used to produce times tables sheets pretty easily.

For subtraction problems, the default setting is to disallow negative numbers in results. For example, the problem "1 - 5 = " will never appear because the answer is -4, and that's a lot for a kindergartner to wrap their head around. You can toggle this behavior off if needed.

For division problems, division by zero is disallowed and will never appear. By default, only numbers that can be divided evenly are shown, for example "9 รท 3 = " is allowed but "10 รท 3 = " is not. If you want to practice finding remainders, this behavior can be toggled off.
