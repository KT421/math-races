# Math Races

This is a very simple shiny app designed to generate math worksheets for my kids.

The functional version is at https://kt421.shinyapps.io/math-races/ but that is a
free shiny.io account so if this gets popular then it will probably be down. You can
clone the repo and run it locally if the shiny.io site is throttled or locked.

Right now it supports addition and subtraction with operands between 0 and 10, and
when Subtraction is selected it will disallow negative numbers in the answers 
For example, "4 - 5 =" will be excluded. 

The produced html document should be sized to fit on a single page. Or at least it does
on my printer. Works on my machine, mate.

Future updates to come at the speed of my kids' progress through the math curriculum.
