# Math Races

This is a very simple shiny app designed to generate math worksheets for my kids.

The functional version is at https://kt421.shinyapps.io/math-races/ but that is a
free shiny.io account so if this gets popular then it will probably be down. Feel
free to clone this repo and run it locally (R/RStudio required but free) if that's 
the case.


Current Features:
- Addition and Subtraction with operands between 0 and 10
- Subtraction mode disallows negative numbers in the answers. For example, "4 - 5 =" will be excluded. 

The produced html document should be sized to fit on a single page. Or at least it does
on my printer. Works on my machine, mate.

Future updates to come at the speed of my kids' progress through the math curriculum. 

Planned Features (in no particular order):
- Toggling negative answers for subtraction
- Larger operand range
- Multiplication
- Division
- Selection of multiple operators for the same worksheet
