# Math Races

This is a very simple shiny app designed to generate math worksheets for my kids.

The functional version is at https://kt421.shinyapps.io/math-races/ but that is a
free shiny.io account so if this gets popular then it will probably be down. Feel
free to clone this repo and run it locally (R/RStudio required but free) if that's 
the case.


Current Features:
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division with operands between 0 and 100
- Toggle whether Subtraction mode disallows negative numbers in the answers. For example, "1 - 5 =" will be excluded unless this is toggled. 
- Toggle whether Division problems with remainders are allowed. For example, "10 รท 3 =" will be excluded unless this is toggled.
- Selection of multiple operators for the same worksheet

The produced html document should be sized to fit on a single page. Or at least it does
on my printer. Works on my machine, mate.

Future updates to come at the speed of my kids' progress through the math curriculum.
