# Description

This document is for working/scratch code for a shiny app that will produce math worksheets for kids.

Starting features: Generates a worksheet of 20 math problems, in large font

Addition with operands between 0 and 5
Subtraction with operands between 0 and 5, no negative numbers in results

Later features:
Operand ranges
Allow negative results
Multiplication and Division

# Basic Logic

```{r}

#Addition

addition_problem <- function(range1 = 1:5, range2 = 1:5) {
  operand1 <- sample(range1,1)
  operand2 <- sample(range2,1)
  paste(operand1, "+", operand2, "=")
}

# Subtraction
subtraction_problem <- function(range1 = 1:5, range2 = 1:5, allow_negatives = F) {
  operand1 <- sample(range1,1)
  operand2 <- sample(range2,1)
  
  if (all(!allow_negatives, operand2 > operand1)) {
    while (operand2 > operand1) {
    operand2 <- sample(range2,1)
    }
  }
  
  paste(operand1, "-", operand2, "=")
}

```
